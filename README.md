# Malaria Parasite Detection

## :derelict_house: Structure

This repository is organised by folders:

- Figures: Contains a collection of visualizations presented in PNG format..
- Notebooks: Houses the jupyter notebook file where most of the development took place.

## Model Abstract

The model predicts whether a cell image is parasitized or not.The model architecture consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction, batch normalization for stabilization, max-pooling layers for down-sampling, fully connected layers for classification, and a final sigmoid output layer for binary classification (malaria detection). 

## Data 

- The Dataset used was Malaria Dataset obtained from Tensorflow Datasets.

- The Dataset contains 27,558 cell images
